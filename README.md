# drum-piano-JS-site
a 2 page JS-produced site, with a drum kit and piano. play the instruments, and write tracks to play later.
A site to play around with, and explore, what we can do with Javascript. I'm still quite new to Javascript, so I hope to add more features at a later date.

on both pages, play by clicking the buttons or pressing the appropiate key.

you can write a track (at the bottom), choose how long between notes, and then play the track you have written.

## what I would like to do

I want to figure out a way of saving the tracks that people have written for a later date. i think this would/could be stored locally, but I haven't figured out yet a good way to do that.
